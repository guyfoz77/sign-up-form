**Live preview: https://guyfoz77.github.io/sign-up-form/**

A first go at working with forms and form elements in HTML. This project is not designed to be accessed through mobile.

Some highlights:
- CSS animations used for the labels for the input elements.
- Javascript to check the passwords match.
